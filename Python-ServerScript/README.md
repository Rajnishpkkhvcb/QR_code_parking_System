# Python--IOT-ServerScript

The solution we offer is to make a plan for the entire parking area, grid it out , 
attach cheap sensors at every parking spot(that detect if a car's there or not) and s
end real time information to the app , provide a pre-booking system using the car 
registration numbers and detect them on entry using cameras , every parking spot is 
linked with a QR code that the user can scan to remember their parking spot shown on 
the app , the moment you park the car a timer starts charging you on time basis and
providing an online payment portal, we collect the data, use a little ml and common
sense to determine the rush hour traffic and parking patterns to predict the filling 
of the parking spots and guide the customers accordingly , we plan to link it with google
maps so that it guides you directly to the parking spot (thereby removing the middle man and 
overall time wastage), overall better dissipation of knowledge as opposed to the current meta 
of going to the place and searching for a parking spot.

Use of GPIO pins, LEDs control. Servo motor for gate. Along with webcam module. OpenCV for 
image processing / Computer vision for number plate detection.
